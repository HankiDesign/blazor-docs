#generic-component-event-issue
>warning [.NET Core Issue 8385](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/8385) is preventing the ValueChanged handler from working at the moment. The code below will work as soon as Microsoft release a fix for this problem. Until then, you may get compilation issue due to the handler presence. We strive to follow best practices and future-proof our components, which is why we are using this approach even though it does not work yet.
